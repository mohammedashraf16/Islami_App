The Islami contains the minimal implementation required to create a new library or project. The repository code is preloaded with some basic components like basic app architecture, app theme, constants and required dependencies to create a new project. This will also help in reducing setup & development time by allowing you to use same code pattern and avoid re-writing from scratch.

### Folder Structure
Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

```
lib/
|- features/
|- constants/
|- l10n/
|- generated/
|- widgets/
|- main.dart
```

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

```
1- constants - All the application level constants are defined in this directory with-in their respective files. This directory contains the constants for `theme`, `preferences` and `strings`.
4- features ‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäContains all the ui of your project, contains sub directory for each screen.
5- l10n‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäContains two files, one file containing all the words related to the application to be translated into arabic and the other into enelish
6- widgets‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäContains the common widgets for your applications. For example, Button, TextField etc.
8- main.dart - This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.
```

### Constants

This directory contains all the application level constants. A separate file is created for each type as shown in example below:

```
constants/
|- my_app_theme.dart
|- strings.dart
|- assets.dart
```
